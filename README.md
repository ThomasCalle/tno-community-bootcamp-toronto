## Description

The TNO Community Bootcamp - Toronto is an introductory coding bootcamp designed for newcomers to the field. The program covers essential topics such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, webpage design, responsive site creation, and effective GitHub Workflow. It is meticulously structured to equip participants with the necessary skills needed to embark on a journey in software development. The program **START: Monday, May 6th, 2024** and **END: Friday, May 31st, 2024**.

Participants will master the primary coding languages and frameworks crucial for success in the IT sector. In addition to the theoretical knowledge gained, the bootcamp concludes with a unique opportunity: a 25-hour volunteer placement with one of our partner agencies or employers. This hands-on experience is invaluable, providing practical skills and a real-world glimpse into IT work environments.

Moreover, the program is designed to enhance key soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership within a supportive learning atmosphere. By integrating technical training with practical experience and soft skills development, my aim is to prepare participants not only for successful careers in the IT industry but also for versatile roles in the broader job market.

## Overview

The main objective of this bootcamp is to introduce coding fundamentals to participants and provide them with the tools and knowledge to begin creating their own web applications.

## The Challenge

The challenge for participants includes:
1. Learning to code in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Python from scratch.
2. Developing responsive webpages that function on devices of all sizes.
3. Managing code and projects on GitHub, emphasizing version control and collaboration.

## Usage Information

Participants are encouraged to actively engage with all materials, complete daily exercises, and collaborate with peers to enhance their learning experience.

## Installation Process

### Downloading This Repository

To download and start using the bootcamp materials, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThomasCalle/tno-community-bootcamp-toronto.git
   ```
   This command creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   After cloning, move into the cloned directory to access the files:
   ```bash
   cd tno-community-bootcamp-toronto
   ```

## Creating Your Own Repository

If you want to create a new project based on what you've learned and track it using Git and GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository".
   - Name your repository and optionally add a description.
   - Choose whether the repository should be public or private.
   - Click "Create repository".

2. **Clone Your New Repository**:
   After creating your new repository on GitHub, clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
   ```
   Replace `your_username` and `your_repository_name` with your actual GitHub username and the name of your new repository.

3. **Add Files and Commit**:
   Move or copy files into your new repository directory. Then, use the following commands to add files to Git, commit them to your local repository, and push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   cd your_repository_name
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with my project files"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Set Upstream Branch** (optional but recommended for easier future operations):
   This step links your local branch to the remote branch on GitHub, simplifying future push and pull operations:
   ```bash
   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
   ```

By following these instructions, you can efficiently manage your projects using Git and GitHub, whether it's downloading existing resources or starting a brand new project.
